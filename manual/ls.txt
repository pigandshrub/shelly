NAME
    ls -- list directories and files
    
USAGE
    ls [directory_or_file_path 1] [directory_or_file_path_2] [...] 

DESCRIPTION
    Typed by itself, ls will print the names of files and directories in the 
    current directory.
    ls can be followed by one or more pathnames, each separated by a space. Each 
    input argument can either be a current or full pathname of an existing file 
    or directory.
    If a file is specified, its name will be printed to the output.
    If a directory is specified, the names of the files and directories in that
    directory will be printed.
