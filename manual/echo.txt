NAME
    echo
    
USAGE
    echo [string1] [...]
    echo [string1] [...] > file_path 
    echo [string1] [...] >> file_path 

DESCRIPTION
    The "echo" command can do one of two things:
    1) Print out a given string on the next line.
    2) Append a string to a file.
    If the file does not exist, a new file will be created at the given path 
    before appending the string to it.
    If the file already exists, depending on which form of echo is used, the 
    file's existing content will either be fully erased or left alone before 
    the string is appended.
    
    The first form of echo will print a given string to output, or a blank line 
    if no string is provided.
    The second form (">") will erase the file's existing content and replace its
    content with the string.
    The third form (">>") will append the string to the file's existing content.
    Both the second and third form of echo will create a new file if a given
    file pathname does not exist.
    All forms of echo can accept multiple string arguments but only one file
    path.
