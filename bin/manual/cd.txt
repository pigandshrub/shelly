NAME
    cd -- change directory
    
USAGE
    cd
    cd directory_path 

DESCRIPTION
    Typed by itself, cd will move the user back to the root directory path, "/".
    If cd is followed by a current directory pathname or full directory 
    pathname, the user will be moved to the directory designated by this path.
    If cd is followed by a file name, the user will be advised that they have 
    not provided a directory, and the user stays at the current directory.
