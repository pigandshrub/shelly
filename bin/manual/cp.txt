NAME
    cp -- copy
    
USAGE
    cp source_file target_file
    cp source_file_or_dir_1 [source_file_or_dir_2] [...] target_directory 
    cp source_directory target_directory

DESCRIPTION
    The "cp" command can copy an old file to a new file, copy one or more old 
    files or the contents of directories into a new directory, or copy the 
    contents of an old directory to a new directory.
    The old files and old directory are left alone.
    If the first and third form of the command is used, and an existing file 
    or directory is specified as the target directory, the user will be asked
    to confirm if they want to overwrite it.
