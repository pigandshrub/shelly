NAME
    mv -- move
    
USAGE
    mv source_file target_file
    mv source_file_or_dir_1 [source_file_or_dir_2] [...] target_directory 
    mv source_directory target_directory

DESCRIPTION
    The "mv" command moves an old file to a new file, moves one or more old 
    files or directories into a new directory, or moves an old directory into a 
    new directory.
    The old files and old directory are deleted.
    If the first and third form of the command is used, and an existing file 
    or directory is specified as the target directory, the user will be asked
    to confirm if they want to overwrite it.
